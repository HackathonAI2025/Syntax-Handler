# ü§ñ AI Code Review Bot (Ollama + FastAPI)

This project is a lightweight backend service that listens to **GitHub Pull Request events** (via Webhooks) and uses a **local Ollama model** to provide AI-powered code reviews.

Whenever a PR is opened or updated, the bot automatically analyzes the changes and posts review comments.
